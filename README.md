# Homework2

## Objective
* To make a basic responsive website about me.

### Contents
*  On the website there is three pages to go through. All three pages are made up of a jumbotron and a nav bar. The links in the nav bars will take you to the other pages which have the same style as the main page. On the home page it's a short description of me with a couple of images to show my interests. The contacts page is where you can place your information and a message to contact me. The last page is the portfolio page which is a bunch of pictures in a jumbotron.

#### Challenges

* I found it difficult getting the layout to work in the navbar. I put a logo with my name because I thought it would look nice but this gave me a couple obstacles when trying to make it all look clean. I also had difficulty making the layout work for small phones on my "Home" page.
